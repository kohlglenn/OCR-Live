# OCR-Live

An interactive program where you can draw a number on a canvas and it is fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Tensorflow to get a real-time prediction of the number you are drawing. You can also pick the color you are drawing with below. If you want to change the model backend, change and run model.py which will update the model used in the ui.
